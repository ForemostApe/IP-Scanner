# IP Range Scanner (Console App)

A simple and asynchronous IP range scanner written in C# using .NET as a part of vocational school. 
This tool allows you to scan a local subnet by specifying a start and end IP address. It pings all hosts in the given range and reports whether each host responds.
Very simplistic and doesn't check that the IP's are on the same subnets or any other more advanced functionality, this was just a test of how the System.Net.NetworkInformation-library works.
